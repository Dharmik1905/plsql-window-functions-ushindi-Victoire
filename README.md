## Course
Database Development with PL/SQL (INSY 8311) â€” Mastery Project

## Business Problem 
Identify top products and customers, quantify monthly trends, and segment customer value to drive marketing and inventory decisions.

## Contents
- `schema_and_sample_data.sql` â€” create tables and insert sample data
- `queries/` â€” SQL files for each window-function query (ranking, aggregate, navigation, distribution, moving averages)
- `screenshots/` â€” 20+ screenshots showing query results and execution in pgAdmin 4
- `README.md` (this file)
- `analysis.md` â€” descriptive/diagnostic/prescriptive analysis
- `references.md` â€” bibliographic sources and academic integrity statement

## How to run (pgAdmin 4 code)
1. Create database `plsql_window_db`.
2. Open Query Tool, run `schema_and_sample_data.sql`.
3. Run the SQL files in `queries/` to reproduce results.
4. Saved screenshots are in `screenshots/` and their commited to my repo.

## Key queries included
- Ranking: top customers using ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), PERCENT_RANK()
- Aggregate: monthly sales with running totals (ROWS vs RANGE)
- Navigation: MoM growth using LAG()
- Distribution: NTILE(4), CUME_DIST()
- Moving averages: 3-month AVG() OVER() rolling

## Key findings (short)
1. Top customers (top quartile) produce 53% of revenue â€” loyalty program recommended.
2. Seasonal spikes observed in April and June; 3-month moving average showed upward trend â€” order more inventory ahead.
